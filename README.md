# supa-fastapi

## NOTE:
**I'm putting this project on hold for the time being; I will wait for the supabase client libraries to mature a little before working on this.**
I'm a maintainer for the Supabase Python Client libraries, and we're actively working on getting them to a useable state. \
As those APIs are quickly changing, any work done on this would end up needing to be re-worked any time a breaking change happens upstream.
